# Calculating Water Affinities in Protein Binding Sites with Grand Canonical Monte Carlo and ProtoMS

Welcome to the ProtoMS Workshop on water binding free energy calculations.


This training workshop will introduce non-specialists to the use of the ProtoMS software package and its unique capabilities for the calculation of binding free energies with Grand Canonical Monte Carlo. It is aimed at individuals with an existing knowledge of molecular modelling techniques and HPC platforms, however does not assume any particular specialist knowledge in Monte Carlo simulation.

Slides from the workshop can be downloaded from this repository.

Questions? You can contact the organisers at jessexgroup@gmail.com.


## Provisional Schedule

* 14:30 [Monte Carlo Simulation and the ProtoMS Code](../MonteCarlo.pdf) - Dr. Chris Cave-Ayland, University of Southampton
* 14:45 [ProtoMS Exercise 1](exercise1.md) - Simulating a Protein-Ligand System
* 16:00 [Introduction to GCMC](../GCMC.pdf) - Hannah Bruce Macdonald, University of Southampton
* 16:15 [ProtoMS Exercise 2](exercise2.md) - GCMC Calculations for Water Binding

Not taking part in the workshop? These materials have been designed so they can be used in a variety of situations but you will likely need access to a computing cluster, the workshop server referenced throughout will not be available after the CCPBioSim Training week. In preparing ProtoMS on a local system you might find [installation instructions](http://www.essexgroup.soton.ac.uk/ProtoMS/Manual/compilation.html) useful. Alternatively, see [this page](https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/bristol2018/server.html) for details of how to setup the image used for the all of the training week workshops on your own system.
